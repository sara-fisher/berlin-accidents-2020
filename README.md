# Berlin Traffic Accidents - 2020

## Project
Examining and visualizing data on Berlin traffic accidents and injuries in 2020.

## Data source
Taken from [Berlin Open Data](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/strassenverkehrsunf%C3%A4lle-nach-unfallort-berlin-2020).

## Scenario
We undertake to find the distribution of accidents by severity (Light, Severe, and Deadly injuries), where they take place, what combinations of vehicles (bikes, cars, pedestrians, etc.) yield what outcomes, what environmental conditions are most problematic, and where in Berlin the accidents take place.

## [Data cleaning](https://github.com/sara-fisher/berlin-accidents-2020/blob/main/Berlin%20accidents%202020.ipynb)
* Checking the data for cleanliness and converting numerical units from European to American formatting
* Translating the column names from German to English
* Converting numerical values to text for visualization purposes

Compiling our findings for stakeholder reference

## What's next?
What effects did the COVID-19 pandemic have on Berlin traffic accidents? We'll take the 2019 dataset from the same data source and compare - most likely in SQL.
